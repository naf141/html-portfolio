<h1>The Best Movies According to Nichole</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse</h3>
<p>This is in one of my top 3 movies because it displays really cool animation, has a great story-line, and involves one of my favorite superhero. The general plot of this movie follows Miles Morales and his origin story into becoming the new Spider-Man. </p>

<h3>Kill Bill - both volumes</h3>
<p>The general vibe of these movies are just great for action and a basic revenge plot. I watched it entirely too young but that's also probably why I'm attached to it.</p>

<h3>Lord of The Rings - all movies</h3>
<p>The reasoning should be obvious: great story, fleshed-out characters, and just overall great fantasy.</p>
